== Description ==

Use Pug (previously Jade) template engine in WordPress themes.

Unfortunately WordPress theme architecture encourages mixing of logic with presentation layer.
Using template-engine like pug it is possible to create better themes by forcing seperation of concerns.
e.g. Default WordPress theme files like `single.php` become controllers as presentation is fully delegated to pug view files.
